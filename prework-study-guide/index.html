        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language</li>
          <li>It is the most basic building block of websites: you could liken it to the foundation, and framing of a building</li>
          <li>HTML handles the content, and its structure, as well as the meaning of each element on a webpage</li>
          <li>HTML is composed of a series of elements. Elements are annotated with angle brackets</li>
          <li>HTML uses 'HEAD' and 'BODY' elements to create the website structure: the 'head' element contains information (metadata) that helps the browser to render the page correctly (this information is not visible to the user), while the 'body' element contains the visible content that the user interacts with on a webpage, or app (like the title, a link, or an image)</li>
              <li> The 'HEAD', and 'BODY' are examples of semantic elements which is self-descriptive of its content and the role it plays on a webpage. Semantic elements should be used whenever possible as they make the html more widely accessible, and easier to read</li>
          <li>Examples of other elements are: </li>
              <li>The 'TITLE' element: defines the title for the webpage. This is a requirement, and is incredibly important for search engine optimization, or SEO</li>
              <li>The 'STYLE' element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>

        </ul>

      <section clas="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is another core technology in building a webpage </li>
          <li>CSS is the language that is used to style the presentation of a website that has been created with HTML through font, color, spacing, etc. </li>
          <li>If HTML is the foundation and framing of a house, CSS would comprise the finishing materials, like trim material, paint color, flooring and tiling materials, the details that give a building its unique character, etc.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that helps to manage and track each version of your project</li>
          <li>Git commands must always start with 'git', and are not the same as bash commands</li>
          <li>Examples of Git commands include:</li>
          <li>git status:checks which repository branch we are currently working in </li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch, and switches to it </li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a lightweight coding language that creates interactivity within and between webpages</li>
          <li>If HTML is our foundation, and framing, and CSS is our style, JavaScript would be the bells and whistles, like electricity, plumbing, internet</li>
