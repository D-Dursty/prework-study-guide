        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language</li>
          <li>It is the most basic building block of websites: you could liken it to the foundation, and framing of a building</li>
          <li>HTML handles the content, and its structure, as well as the meaning of each element on a webpage</li>
          <li>HTML is composed of a series of elements. Elements are annotated with angle brackets</li>
          <li>HTML uses 'HEAD' and 'BODY' elements to create the website structure: the 'head' element contains information (metadata) that helps the browser to render the page correctly (this information is not visible to the user), while the 'body' element contains the visible content that the user interacts with on a webpage, or app (like the title, a link, or an image)</li>
              <li> The 'HEAD', and 'BODY' are examples of semantic elements which is self-descriptive of its content and the role it plays on a webpage. Semantic elements should be used whenever possible as they make the html more widely accessible, and easier to read</li>
          <li>Examples of other elements are: </li>
              <li>The 'TITLE' element: defines the title for the webpage. This is a requirement, and is incredibly important for search engine optimization, or SEO</li>
              <li>The 'STYLE' element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
              <li>The 'BASE' element defines the base URL for a website</li>
              <li>The 'LINK' element connects an external  resource to the HTML doc</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is another core technology in building a webpage </li>
          <li>CSS is the language that is used to style the presentation of a website that has been created with HTML through font, color, spacing, etc. </li>
          <li>If HTML is the foundation and framing of a house, CSS would comprise the finishing materials, like trim material, paint color, flooring and tiling materials, the details that give a building its unique character, etc.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using a CSS line: Inline CSS, Internal CSS Style Sheet, and an External CSS Style Sheet.</li>
          <li>An EXTERNAL CSS Style Sheet is the most commonly utilized. It allows developers to keep all CSS rules in a separate file, making changes easier. When using an external style sheet the file is linked using a 'link' element placed in the HTML's 'head' element.</li>
          <li>An INTERNAL CSS Style Sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the 'head' section of the HTML file, and the CSS rule only apply to that webpage.</li>
          <li>INLINE CSS is hyper-local and is used for styling a single line of HTML, like a specific heading. Each inline style must be edited individually. Inline CSS is useful for quick, and permanent changes, but are less flexible than External and Internal CSS Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>In CSS rules, a 'SELECTOR" defines teh element, or attributes, to which the rules, or declarations, will apply. A 'DECLARATION' contains two important components: the CSS property we want to apply, like color, and the value we want to apply, like yellow. </li>
          <li>A CSS 'CLASS ATTRIBUTE' allows us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>The 'MARGIN' property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The 'PADDING' property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding you increase the size of the entire element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that helps to manage and track each version of your project</li>
          <li>Git commands must always start with 'git', and are not the same as bash commands</li>
          <li>Examples of Git commands include:</li>
          <li>git status:checks which repository branch we are currently working in </li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch, and switches to it </li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a lightweight coding language that creates interactivity within and between webpages</li>
          <li>If HTML is our foundation, and framing, and CSS is our style, JavaScript would be the way we interact with our building by turning on/off the light, opening a door, turning on the water, etc.</li>
          <li>A 'VARIABLE' is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. To declare a variable in JavaScript (JS) we use the keyword 'VAR' followed by a name, like var shape = "circle". In this example, the equal sign is the "operator" which assigns the specific date</li>
          <li>A 'STRING' is all of the components assigned to the variable.</li>
          <li>'CONTROL FLOW' is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        </ul>
